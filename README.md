# Diplom_2

This is a second part of my Diplom project on 'QA Java Automation testing' course. This part dedicated to REST API automation testing.
The task was to develop API automated tests for Burgers sell application.

### I used:
- Java   
- JUnit 4  
- RestAssured
- Allure plugin (for test results representation)
